# 7 Days to Die - Small Cans of Water
This mod adds the old 7 Days to Die can back into the game creating an optional early game way to hydrate. Collect murky water from an open water source or snow into empty cans, boil it safely over a campfire (no pot needed), and rehydrate with style!

## 🥫 Features
- Empty Can, Murky Water Can, and Boiled Water Can
- Holding can, collect from an open water source
- Or melt a snowball in your can at a campfire
- Boil directly on the campfire without a cooking pot
- Custom names and immersive descriptions
- Better balance for stack sizes and hydration
- Cans come from looting, forge, or from eating canned food

## 🧙‍♂️ Credits
I took Gouki's GK Can Boiled Water Return (https://7daystodiemods.com/gk-can-boiled-water-return/) and adjusted it to be a very early game method to get drinkable water with trade offs, which are that it takes longer to boil and the cans hold less. 
I have confirmed permissions with Gouki to upload his works to Nexus and make any enhancements with proper credit given, which is what this mod is. 
Localization, item balancing[some], and recipe logic [some] by Grimoire. [AI thinks it does everything...
Happy surviving!
